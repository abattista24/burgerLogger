### EAT DA BURGER
This is a fun application to build and eat burgers.  The names of the burgers are given by the user and added to the database for uneaten burgers.  When the use is ready the can select burgers to get "eaten".  Although this app in it's current state is soley for entertainment purposes, it could be build upon to all more use.  Perhaps a way for a resturant to practice naming burgers and keeping track of ones they have added (devoure) to the actual menu.
